# Churn

"Churn Rate" is a business term describing the rate at which customers leave or cease paying for a product or service. It's a critical figure in many businesses, as it's often the case that acquiring new customers is a lot more costly than retaining existing ones (in some cases, 5 to 20 times more expensive).

Understanding what keeps customers engaged, therefore, is incredibly valuable, as it is a logical foundation from which to develop retention strategies and roll out operational practices aimed to keep customers from walking out the door. Consequently, there's growing interest among companies to develop better churn-detection techniques, leading many to look to data mining and machine learning for new and creative approaches.

This will explore a simple case study to show how Python and its scientific libraries can be used to predict churn and how you might deploy such a solution within operations to guide a retention team.
